I have just published a simple [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow that provides easier access to [flickr’s API documentation](https://www.flickr.com/services/api) and the API explorer. It’s not very complex, but is useful for someone (like me) who uses the flickr API regularly

You can get it from [https://github.com/3thirty/alfred-flickr-api](https://github.com/3thirty/alfred-flickr-api)
