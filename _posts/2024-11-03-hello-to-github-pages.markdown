This site (using jekyll via github pages) is replacing my 17-year old wordpress installation on 3thirty.net (archived on the wayback machine: [https://web.archive.org/web/20240224095106/http://3thirty.net/](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224095106/http://3thirty.net/)

I'm not bothering to bring over any of the posts that are more than 10 years old, and are about very outdated technology, but hopefully I'll have some more interesting things to add here soon.

In the meantime, old, outdated code is in my public github repos at [https://www.github.com/3thirty](https://web.archive.org/web/20240224095106/http://3thirty.net/)
